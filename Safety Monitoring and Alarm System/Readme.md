# 🚨 Safety Monitoring and Alarm System
- The Safety Monitoring and Alarm System is a robust embedded solution designed to monitor environmental conditions and respond to hazardous events in real time. Tailored for hospital environments, it ensures safety through multi-sensor detection, intelligent control, and instant wireless alerting.

## ⚙️ Key Features
### 🧠 Master-Slave Architecture with ATmega32
#### Master MCU (ATmega32):

- Interfaces directly with environmental sensors.

- Analyzes data and controls actuators (fan, lights, pumps).

- Sends real-time alerts via ESP8266 Wi-Fi module using UART.

- Communicates with the Slave MCU via SPI to delegate control signals when needed.

#### Slave MCU (ATmega32):

- Acts as a command receiver and hardware controller for extended systems.

- Executes operations on actuators based on commands received from the Master MCU.

### 🌡️ Sensor Integration
#### LM35 Temperature Sensor:

- Detects room temperature.

- Triggers the fan when temperature exceeds a preset threshold.

#### LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):

- Measures ambient light intensity.

- Controls lighting based on daylight availability.

#### 2× Flame Sensors:

- Detect presence of fire.

- Initiate emergency response (alarm and water pumps).

#### MQ2 Gas Sensor:

- Detects smoke or hazardous gases.

- Triggers alarms and safety actions.

### 🔁 Actuator Control
- Fan: Activated by temperature thresholds.

- Lights: Adjusted automatically based on ambient light.

- Water Pumps: Triggered by flame detection.

- Buzzer/Alarm: Activated during gas leaks or fire.

### 📡 Real-Time Wireless Alerts
#### ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module:

- Connected directly to the Master MCU via UART.

- Sends immediate alerts to a monitoring server or cloud dashboard.

- Ensures timely notification of critical safety events.

### 🔗 SPI Communication
- The Master MCU uses SPI to send actuator control commands to the Slave MCU.

- Ensures efficient task offloading and hardware abstraction.

### 🔌 PWM-Based Control
#### PWM signals generated by the Master MCU:

- Control fan speed based on temperature.

- Dim or brighten lights based on sunlight intensity.

### 🧩 System Components
- 2× ATmega32 Microcontrollers (Master & Slave)

- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module

- LM35 Temperature Sensor

- LDR Sensor

- 2× Flame Sensors

### 🧠 Purpose
#### Built to enhance hospital safety infrastructure, this system provides:

- Continuous monitoring of environmental threats.

- Automated emergency response via actuators.

- Instant alerts to medical or technical staff via Wi-Fi.

- It minimizes hazards, ensures faster response, and maintains a safe hospital environment for patients and staff.
