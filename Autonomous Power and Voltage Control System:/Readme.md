- This module ensures a stable, uninterrupted power supply for embedded systems using a dual-source design with manual switching and regulated multi-voltage output.
### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:
#### Dual Power Source with Seamless Transition:
- A mechanical switch allows toggling between a 12V DC adapter and a 12V battery. Designed so that no voltage drop occurs during transition, ensuring continuous operation of connected systems.
#### Voltage Regulation Stages:
- 12V Output via 7812 regulator

- 5V Output via 7805 (for microcontrollers and digital logic)

- 9V Output via 7809 (for medium-voltage components)
#### Power Conditioning:
- Capacitors (C1‚ÄìC5) are placed at each regulator stage to stabilize voltage and suppress noise, improving performance and lifespan of connected devices.
#### Pin Headers for Modularity:
- Clearly labeled 12V, 6V, and 5V headers provide flexible access points to power different parts of the system independently.

### üß† Purpose:
- This system is ideal for embedded projects that require reliable, noise-free power across multiple voltage levels. It isolates power delivery for different modules, protecting sensitive components and supporting modular embedded development.
